Networking, as defined by the Oxford dictionary, is the &amp;ldquo;action or process of interacting with others to exchange information and develop professional or social contacts&amp;rdquo;.
Networking, as defined by my past experiences, is the &amp;ldquo;action or process where you get to dress fancy and drink beers with professionals from prospective fields, however given that you&amp;rsquo;re a lightweight but also slightly alcoholic, slowly get drunk off like 2 pints whilst trying your hardest to remain professional and not slur while talking with the CEO of the biggest superannuation company in Austrlaia&amp;rdquo;.</description>
