*These are a collection of quotes/papers/ideas which I found interesting from the book Deep Medicine, thought I'd share*  

Life can ony be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.  

...[AI] has great potential to help, but also to harm, to exaggerate the profound gap that already exists between those who have much and those who have less each passing year.  

We [doctors] fail to follow proven guidelines, and we fail in the art by not seeing the unique *person* in front of us. We know their gemone, but by not *listening* to their story, we don't register their broken heart.  

The glaring example is in the electronic healthcare record systems (EHRs) currently in use in most hospitals. These EHRs were designed for billing, not for ease of use by physicians and nurses. They have affected physician well-being and are responsible for burnout and attrition; moreover, they have forced an inattentiveness to the patient by virtue of an intruder in the room: the screen that detracts from the person before us.  

In *intoxicated by My Illness*, Anatole Broyard articulates a wish that his urologist would "brood on my situation for perhaps five minutes, that he would give me his whole mind just once, be bonded with me for a brief space, survey my soul as well as my flesh, to get at my illness, *for each man is ill in his own way*."  

Each man and woman is ill in his or her own way.  

It is more important to know what sort of person has [a] disease than to know what sort of disease a person has.  

When we are ill, we have a fundamental need to be *cared* for; disease infantilizes us, particularly when it is severe, and though we want the most advanced technical skills, scientific precision, the best therapy, and though we would want our physicians to "know" us (and unlike the time of Hippocrates, such knowing includes the genome, proteome, metabolome, transcriptome, predictions driven by AI, and so on), we bdly want it to be expressed in the form of a caring, conscientious physician and healthcare team.  

...creation of a 'bespoke' experience for patients.  

As machines get smarter and take on suitable tasks, humans might actually find it easier to be more humane.  

AI is capable of learning what to do only by examining existing evidence. (Implying that it is unable to generate innovations of new diagnoses).  

The promise of artificial intelligence in medicine is to provide composite, panoramic views of individuals' medical data; to improve decision making; to avoid errors such as misdiagnosis and unnecessary procedures; to help in the ordering and interpretation of appropriate tests; and to recommend treatment.  

Medicine [should] be democratized -- that medical paternalism would face as consumers didn't simply generate their information but owned it, had far greater access to their medical data, and ultimately could (if they chose to) take considerably more charge of their care.  

Deep phenotyping is both thick, spanning as many types of data as you can imagine, and long, covering as much of our lives as we can, because many metrics of interest are dynamic, constatnly changing over time.  

We need medical data that spanned "from prewomb to tomb".  

By the end of 2017, [healthcare] is now the largest employer in the United States, towering over retail. By every metric, the amount of money spent on healthcare has exploded.  

[This is spoken with regards to electronic health records:] Now, the highest-ever proportion of doctors and nurses are experiencing burnout and depression owing to their inability to provide real care to patients, which was their basis for pursuing a medical career.  

The secret of the care of the patient is caring for the patient.  


AI can also revolutionize other aspects of our lives that are, in one sense or another, upstream from the clinic. A huge one is how we eat. One of the unexpected and practical accomplishments of machine learning to date has been to provide a potential scientific basis for individualized diets.  

The increased efficiency and workflow could either be used to squeeze clinicians more, or the gift of time could be turned back to patients -- to use the future to bring back the past. The latter objective will require human activism, especially among clinicians, to stand up for the best interest of patients.  

The deficiencies in the patient-doctor relationship and errors in medical practice are interdepenent: the superficial contact with patients promotes incorrect diagnoses and the reflexive ordering of tests or treatments that are uncessary or unsound.  

[Doctors] haven't had access to patients in their real world, on the go, at work, while asleep. The data doctors access are from the contrived setting of a medical office, constrained by the temporal limits of the visit itself.  

Over the period from 1975 to 2010, the new, routine use of mammography led to a 30 percent increase in the diagnosis of breast cancer, but over the same period there was no sign of reduced incidence of metastatic disease. (Reference: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1600249)  

Recent studies challenges the traditional dogma of cancer taking many years to decades to form before it becomes invasive, showing that a tumor can spread in some patients at a very early phase of its development. (References: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974802/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974799/, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evolution-research-could-revolutionize-cancer-therapy/)  

One important tool that has widespread awareness in medicine but is nevertheless regularly ignored is Bayes's theorem, which describes how knowledge about the conditions surrounding a possible event affect the probability that it happens. So, althought we know about 12 percent of women will develop breast cancer during their lifetime, that does not mean that every woman has a 12 percent chance of developing breast cancer. For example, we know that people with certain BRCA gene mutations carry a very high risk, along with those who have a high genetic risk score.  

There appears to be a highly significant factor for the *alarming* and *disproportionate* maternal mortality rate among Black women. (Reference: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html)  

To be a good diagnostician, a physician needs to acquire a large set of labels for diseases, each of which binds an idea of the illness and its symptoms, possible antecedents and causes, possible developments and consequences, and possible interventions to cure or mitigate the illness.  

System 1 thinking -- thinking that is automatic, quick, intuitive, effortless. This system of thinking usees heuristics, or rules of thumb: the reflexive, mental shortcuts that bypass any analytic process, promoting rapid solutions to a problem. System 2 thinking, in contrast, is a slow,. reflective process involving analytic effort. It occurs in a different area of the brain and even has distinct metabolic requirements. (Reference: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-010-1834-0_8)  

If you don't get feedback, your confidence grows much faster than your accuracy. (Reference: *Superforecasting*)  

There are about 10,000 human diseases, and there's not a doctor who could recall any significant fraction of them. If doctors can't remember a possible diagnosis when making up a differential, then they will diagnose according to the possibilities that are mentally "available" to them, and an error can result. This is called the *availability bias*.  

Their personal experience as doctors can override hard data derived from much larger samples of people, say, about the likelihood that a patient has some rare disease, simply because an earlier patient with similar symptoms had that rare disease.  

In the paper "Behaving Discretely: Heuristic Thinking in the Emergency Department", it describes a discontinuity in the data that indicates doctors were classifying patients as too young to have heart disease, even though the actual risk of a forty-year-old having a fatal heart attack is not much greater than the risk of a thirty-nine-year-old patient having one. (Reference: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c4d7/a884a3295fb531104fe367fbfbdf3827a29d.pdf)  

Further complicating the matter for diagnostic applications is that not only are symptoms subjective, how they are conveyed by the patient via descriptors, facial expression, and body language is critical and often cannot be readily captured by a few words.  

Doctors hoping to facilitate diagnostic accuracy can crowdsource data with their peers and find help with diagnostic work. This isn't exactly System 2 thinking, but taking advantage of the reflexive input and experience of multiple specialists.  

Human Dx intends to recruit at least 100,000 doctors by 2022 and increase the use of natural-language-processing algorithms to direct the key data to the appropriate specialists, combining AI tools with doctors crowdsourcing.  

[Face2Gene] app from FDNA...can help the diagnosis for more than 4,000 genetic conditions, many of which can be extremely difficult to pinpoint. An example is a child with the rare Coffin-Siris syndrome. The app makes the diagnosis by recognizing unique facial features in seconds, whereas in some families it has taken up to sixteen years of extensive and expensive evaluations for humans to make the same diagnosis.  

Machine learning tends to work best if you give it enough data and the rawest data you can. Because if you have enough of it, then it should be able to filter out the noise by itself.  

...my plan [for the book] is to avoid the nitty-gritty and instead try to cover only what is most germane to medicine about the technologies we examine.  

Present-day dogma holds that organisms are algorithms, and that algorithms can be represented in mathematical formulas...."Algorithm" is arguably the single most important concept in our world. If we want to understand our life and our future, we should make every effort to understand what an algorithm is, and how algorithms are connected with emotions....[E]motions are biochemical algorithms that are vital for the survival and reproduction of all mammals....99 percent of our decisions--including the most important life choices concerning spouses, careers and habitats--are made by the highly refined algorithms we call sensations, emotions and desires.  

There are even claims that DNA markers can enable an accurate prediction of a person's face, and therefore identity, leading to sharp rebuke. (Reference: https://www.pnas.org/content/114/38/10166)  

UCSD researchers used machine learning of human faces for determining pain, which was shown to be more accurate than human perception. (Reference: https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/reading-pain-in-a-human-face/)  

Certain tasks might be achieved by AI, like accurately diagnosing a skin lesion or ear infection via an algorithm. But, for medicine as a whole, we will never tolerate lack of oversight by human doctors and clinicians across *all* conditions, *all* the time.
