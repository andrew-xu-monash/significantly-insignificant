Its 9am on a Monday morning and I really don't feel like doing any work.  

SO, instead I'm going to go through a very interesting question which popped up during GAMSAT preparation yesterday. In my opinion, my answer is ultimately the superior answer; HOWEVER, certain individuals (whose name I shall not reveal) argued that the alternative solution is better. So instead of doing my actual job of data analysis & visualisation of the prevalence of perinatal depression in women, I'm going to run an in-depth analysis of pickles.  

The main premise of the question is as follows:  

> You're shrunk to the size of a pickle and put in a blender, how do you get out?  
> A: Lie flat beneath the blades until the blender is turned off  
> B: Try to destory the motor of the blender from the inside  
> C: Go to the sides of the blender, wait for it to be turned on and spin to the top  

Before diving into the logistics of which answer is the most optimal, it's best to extract as much additional information from the prompt as possible.  

All three answers incorporate some type of movement or action, which implies that we retain a similar degree of mobility & intelligence while we're the size of a pickle. However, there is insufficient evidence to assume that we have the same physical strength, lets assume that an individual's physical capabilities decreases at a rate proportionally to its body size decrease.  

Additionally, option A contains the phrase "...until the blender is turned off", which indicates that the blender that you're trapped in, will in fact, turn on after a short while. This means that (obviously) the primary goal in this scenario is to survive the initial blending, and then determine the best method of escape.  

Furthermore, [**wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_cucumber) suggests that the average size of a pickle ranges from 4cm to 6cm. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that it's 6cm.  

Through some thorough research on blenders, I've concluded that there are two main types of blenders, which vary in their methodlogy of use; but according to [**this article**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender), there are two main types of blenders: the *immersion* blender (which is a handheld tool with no container of its own, but instead has a mixing head with rotating blades that can be immersed in a container) and the *contertop* blender (which is the traditional container + blender on the bottom of said container). Since solution A mentions that it's possible to "lie flat beneath the blades", it is safe to assume that the category of blender is of relevance here is, infact, an immersion blender.  

Now, from personal experience, there are typically two types of designs of an immersion blender container, which can be seen by my masterful drawings of them:  

![blender type 1](/post/2019-12-02-the-pickle-dilemma-an-in-depth-analysis-on-why-arghavan-is-wrong_files/blender_1.JPG)
![blender type 2](/post/2019-12-02-the-pickle-dilemma-an-in-depth-analysis-on-why-arghavan-is-wrong_files/blender_2.JPG)  

The container is outlined by black, the rotor is shown in dark blue, and the blades are depicted in red. The most common design is shown on the left, where there a single set of blades on the very bottom, which we shall refer to as "base blades". The more advanced version, which are becoming increasingly prevalent nowadays due to its versatility & power, has additional blades located superior to its base blades.  

Given that the purpose of a blender is to, surprisingly, blend things, it is *specifically engineered & refined to do this in the most efficient and sophisticated ways possible*. This is exemplified in both its container and base blade designs. The container for both types of countertop blenders are slightly slanted, with an almost inverted conical shape; this is done to ensure that all of the unblended objects *slide down* to the bottom of the container, where it can be blended by the base blades. The base blades typically have four blades in the shape of a cross; interestingly, each of the individual blades alternates in bending either up or down. This allows the blades to create a very vigorous "twisting" motion which creates almost a whirlpool of blended objects. The combination of these two designs underly the fundamental effectiveness of a blender.  

Now, applying these facts to the question prompt. It's a good idea to run a simluation in our heads, aka a "thought experiment" on what would be the most expected outcome of each of the solutions.  

Option A: although there is very little space between the base blades & the bottom of the container (approximately 1.5cm, I measured it myself), with proper movement and positioning, it is posslbe for a hypothetically pickled person to lie on their backs and avoid the rotation of the blades. Thus, the pickle-individual would be able to successfully avoid the initial blending, leaving his brain intact to think of any subsequent solutions to escape this hellhole.  

Option B: as stated above, if we assume that the strengh of an individual decreases at a rate proportional to the rate of physical shrinkage, there is no way for them to break the motor on the interior. A typical blender has a very tough rubber band surrounding the bottom of the base blade, completely covering the motor. This is designed with the intention to protect the motor from potential food scraps, however this line of protection is more than sufficient to deter pickle-sized humans from damaging any part of the motor.  

Option C: now this is the interesting one. While the other two solutions doesn't specify how the individual should move, option C states explicitly that the individual should stand *on top* of the blades and *wait for it to spin* so that it can utilise the torque generator by the motor to *spin out of the container*. [**This website**](https://joyofblending.com/vitamix-speed-measured/) suggests that a blender achieves an average of 10,000 revolutions per minute, which is equivalent to 90-120 miles per hour (depending on the length of the blade). For the sake of simplicity, lets assume that the blade rotates at the speed of 100 miles per hour, which according to [**wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force) is equivalent to 5.4 units of g-force. Any individual stand on top of the base blades as it starts to spin would experience an acceleration of ~5.4 g originating from their foot; if we follow the basic principles of motion & displacement, it is evident that there is no way that a person would able to survive this. Best case scenario, the sudden displacement of their foot & lower limbs would cause the individual to lose balance, causing whiplash. Worst case scenario, the displacement and subsequent loss of balance would result in the individual diving head-first into the now fully rotating blades.  

In conclusion, my analysis elucidates that option A is obviously the safest and most logical option, and Arghavan should listen to Sahil when he says that option C sucks.  

Thanks for coming to my ted talk <3
