This is a creation arising from sheer boredom and the very essence of procrastination - the exact, stereotypical combination of elements surrounding your typical university student. I've got 2 exams that I've got to study for, but goddamn 2 shots of coffee really goes a long way to keep me distracted from doing actual work.

I intend to use this as a way to keep track of anything & everything interesting with my life (so realistically not much). But I thought it would be hilarious for the future me to reflect back on my past thoughts & experiences and see how much of an idiot I was.

For potential employers, I am a motivated individual who is extremely passionate about whatever field I'm applying for. I believe that my [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-xu-monash/) would be a great source of my professional experiences.

For any passerbys who found this blog within the depths of the internet, hola!  But I doubt you'll find anything remotely intellectually stimulating here.s
