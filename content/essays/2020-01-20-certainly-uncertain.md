It's 9pm and I'm drunk, we'll see how this goes.  

## Certainly Uncertain  

Let's play the century old moral hypothetics game: a train is heading down a Y-intersection, the one it's guided towards has 5 individuals bound to it. The other rail has one individual on it. You are standing right next to the tracks, with a lever by your side. If you pull the lever, the train switches rails. If you pull the lever, you're killing one person and saving the other 5. If you don't pull the lever, you're leaving the 5 people to die. Would you do it? Or just let it slip? Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy; there's vomit on his shirt already, mom's spaghetti-  

Wait sorry got off topic. Let's focus here. Would you, pull the lever, and face the consequences? Or would you not pull the lever, and be left with the guilt that you could've saved 5 people whilst sacrificing one?  

Now this is where it gets interesting, let's change the scenario, but leave the fundamental facts untouched.  

Imagine this, you're a doctor working in an emergency department in the middle of a summer Saturday night, where it's 35 degrees outside but Melbourne weather also reports a 90% chance of rain (??? - not relevant). Suddenly, there's some freakish car accident, and now 4 patients flood into the emergency room all requiring immediate care. One's in critical need of a heart transplant, one's in critical need of a lung transplant, one's in (sorta) critical need of a lung transplant, one's got most of her kidneys torn out, and a kid is going through a serious organ failure and needs a new one (honestly can't think of another organ so let's just roll with it). Now, let's say that a healthy individual just happens to walk into the emergency room by accident (heh), and you (somehow) knew that he's a perfect match for organ donation for all five patients. Would you take this person's organs and give them to the patients in need? If you do so, you're effectively saving 5 people, whilst killing one person (same as before). If you choose to do nothing, one person walks off, but 5 people die, and you are still left with the conscience that you *could have* saved 5 people whilst sacrificing one.  

Not gonna lie this isn't some philiosophical point I'm trying to reach here, it's just a cool thought experiment I read somewhere which emphasises how stupid the train-lever question is in judgement of a person's morals. There is no numerical metric which effectively measures the "value" of any individual, and telling a person (or worse, a doctor) to choose between one or the other is astronomically idiotic.
