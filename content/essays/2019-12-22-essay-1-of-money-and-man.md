## Of Money and Man  

Upon reflection of the major conflicts & warfare occurred in the previous century, it is of no doubt that they're revolved around the beliefs in starkly contrasting socio-economic ideologies and the subsequent impulse of individuals to enforce their beliefs on the rest of the world. The Cold War, which lasted more than the better half of the 20th century, further elucidates the stubbornness of such ideologies and their followers. However, if we critically and objectively analyse these philosophies based on their real-life applications and future trajectory, one can see that each side of the argument is imperfect.  

The most widely accepted socio-economic philosophy within the modern world, capitalism, had initially arisen with humble intentions. Building on the basis of free market & trading, its fundamental framework suggested that those who worked the hardest would also be reward the most. This can no better be represented than America in the 1960s, with its booming economy and rapid advancements in technology. "The American Dream" - dictated by individual's desire to gain money (and consequently power), drew faint, yet defined lines within the socio-economic environment, creating a hierarchy of social classes, with the middle (working) class fueling the vast majority of America's economy.  

However, despite the many great things that were born from capitalism, there are certain factors within the development of a capitalistic economy that are becoming increasingly problematic within the modern society. With the emergence of massive corporations having the main goal of generating as much revenue as possible for its investors, it drastically increases the amount of wealth being accumulated by few individuals belonging to the upper class. Consequently, this pushes for a greater divide amongst the social classes, ultimately resulting in a rapidly diminishing middle class with the majority of its population on the brink of delving into the lower class.  

Furthermore, certain public sectors are also being increasingly privatised by corporations, which shifts its intended purpose of serving the people towards a more monetary focused direction while simultaneously contradicting the mere essence of capitalism. An example of this in the modern world is America's current healthcare system, where it's almost entirely privatised in major metropolitan regions. This subsequently removes the possibility for healthy market competition for service prices, resulting in these hospitals being able to raise their prices as high as they desire. Access to healthcare, which should be an essential requirement for modern living, is not restricted only to those who have money due to the unintended effects of capitalism.  

Contrastingly, initially postulated by Karl Marx as a solution against the many shortcomings of capitalism, socialism strives to eliminate the existence of social classes through an equal distribution of wealth and assets to all. However, despite the soundness of the theory on paper, its practical application proved to be difficult. Displayed in both China and Russia as Communism, its fundamental framework overlooked perhaps the most crucial aspect of human behaviour - incentive. Observed and explained by numerous experiments in the field of behavioural economics, it is without a doubt that incentives (regardless of its nature) is the main driver for motivation. Thus, when there is an equal distribution of wealth regardless of how much effect is required to put into working, it results in a lack of incentive for individuals to work. When no-one has the motivation to work more than expected, it results in an overall decrease in productivity, and subsequently amount of wealth generated. This is reflected in the extreme poverty that the majority of populations suffered in both countries.  

Ultimately, both extremities of the socio-economical spectrum has their benefits and unforgiving downside, thus it is illogical to argue that either ideology is empirically superior to the other. However, we should learn from the mistakes we've made from adopting such ideologies, and aim to create a society with a hybrid between the two in order to capitalise on the benefits of both.
