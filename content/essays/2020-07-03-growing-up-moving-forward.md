**Side note:** this topic actually came up as one of the two essay topics for the 2020 may GAMSAT, and I used the ideas behind this specific essay as a basic structure. I managed to get a relatively high score in this section of the test, so funnily enough, if I do end up pursuing medicine, it's because of a quote from Master Ooguay from Kung-Fu Panda.  

> All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development given the individual.  

> Growth is never by mere chance, it is the result of forces working together.  

> Society is a sort of organism on the growth of which conscious efforts can exercise little effect.  

> Human society is a ceaseless growth, and unfoldment in terms of spirituality.  

## Growing Up, Moving Forward  

Growth over time in all aspects tangible & invisible defines who we are as individuals. Whilst the growth of one person has negligible impact on society, the development of society cannot exist without the cumulative growth of everyone living in it.  

From an individualistic point of view, growth can mean very different things. We grow physically. From infant to child, where we explore the many wonders of the world. From child to teenagers, where we start to question and challenge the more abstract, intangible aspects of life. From teenagers into young adults, where we become independent from our parents and take our first steps into life, instilled with passion and excitement. Every step of the way, we are heavily influenced by those surrounding us, for our inexperience in life subject us to adhere to other's interpretation of it. We also growth mentally, however this is not mandatory, as maturity is a decision urged by responsibility. It is the ability for an individual to reflect upon the past, through both retrospection and the introspective reasoning bheind it, that truly allows for one to grow. The ability to admit wronging in the past, acknoledge personal flaws, and willingness to address them in the future is unequivocally the best path a person could follow. However, it is important to note not to dwell too much on the mistakes of the past, for "yester is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift, that's why it's called the present".  

In macroscopic lens, the impact of growth & development of individuals on the broader society may seem insignificant. This is true to some degree; on average, the accomplishments, or demise, of one person will affect his immediate peers and family, it may affect the community surrounding him, but it will certainly not have a significant influence on anything higher. However, it can be argued that a society's ability to growth & progress in all aspects social, political, technological and cultural is simply an extension of the cumulative development of all individuals residing in it. By extension, the ability for a society to undergo change, whether it is by choice or duress, is completely reliant on the willingness of individuals to do so. An example of this can be observed from the devastating impacts of COVID-19 across the world. Although it is in the best interests for a society that everyone self-isolate to prevent further infections, the subbornness & resistance from individuals within it may sabotage the cumulative efforts of everyone else.  

Overall, one can see that not only is the growth of individuals important for their own development, it is also impactful (despite not in a tangible manner) to the wider society. By extension, it is also one's ability to self-reflect, and willingness to cooperate, which ultimately leads to both personal and societal growth.
