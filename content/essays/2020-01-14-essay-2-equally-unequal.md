## Equally Unequal  

One can argue that the fundamental basis for equality arises from an evolutionary background, where cooperation between individuals often resuted in a higher probability of survival. Nonetheless, it is without a doubt that we humans are intrinsically programmed to seek equality, and the effects of this permeates through both micro & macro scopes of modern society. However, it is also important that we do not take the definition of equality too literally in practice, for there are severe consequences.  

Equality, by definition, can be interpreted as "distribution of resources to ensure success". We are imbued with an alomost fundamental desire to seek equality. On a micro scale, we have a desire to ensure that none of our family nor friends are suffering; and this is reflected by our ability to empathise with those who are less fortunate. For example, the recent bushfires all over Australia has had devastating impacts on families. However, epople from all over the coutnry has donated millions of dollars to help those in need. These people did not have any legal obligation to do so, but they did because they saw others in need, and they are willing to sacrifice parts of their monetary gaisn to achieve equality.  

Additionally, this trend of moral philosophy is also exhibited by larger scale organisations and government bodies. Due to their centralised systems of resource management and advanced decision making skills, their actions are much more pronounced and long lasting. Many different parties often work together to achieve a unifying goal towards equality. For example, there are numerous regulations (laid out by the government) and programs (orchastrated by universites) which offer easier access to university courses to counteract demographical biases. E.g. the recent movement across various major universities which now offer lower entrance barriers to female students wishing to study STEM degrees. This can be interpreted as a method of promotion equality within a societal scope.  

However, despite the obvious benefits which equality brings, blind support for equality may result in damaging consequences. This is illustrated within the varying socio-economical systems, which have different interpretations of equality. For example, Australia embodies a mixed sicio-economic philosophy which promotes equality via heavy taxation of the rich & implementation of government-funeded welfare systems to ensure a basic living standard for all people. In stark contrast, a purely communist socio-economic system strictly argues for a complete equal distribution of all resources across all people, regardless of how much net wealth there are. As a consequence, there is a lack of basic living standards, ultimately resulting in entire societies living in extreme poverty (e.g. USSR, China in the 20th century).  

Ultimately, equality is a blessing which we all possess as individuals. Our ability to empathise with others on both a micro and macro scale is one of the fundamental basis for our success as societies today. However, we must consider the consequences of interpreting equality too literally.
