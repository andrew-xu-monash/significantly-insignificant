## To Inifinity & Beyond  

"Shoot for the stars, and if you miss, you'll be lost in space, suffocating". Space exploration has been, is currently, and will always be a contentious topic in the feilds of economics and philosophy.  

Historically, space exploration has been utilised as a tool for competition between nations of differing ideologies. During the height of the cold war in the 1960s, lines were drawn in all frontiers of mathetmatics, chess, sports, and especially technological advancements. Space exploration was a mutually agreed method of determining which country had superior technology. Therefore, when America first landed on the moon in 1969, it signified a tremendous victory for democracy. With the fall of USSR not too long after, allowing American culture to become the major influence over the rest of the world, it can be argued that space travel has been a quintessential element of defining the world's history.  

Despite the historical significance, some may argue that current pursuits of space exploration is economically irresponsible, since there are a plethora of other much more urgen issues regarding humanity which needs to be addressed (e.g. climate change). Furthermore, some may even argue that space travel is a "waste of money". Whilst both arguments are understandable, and the notion of physically sending a multi-million dollar object into the unknown can easily be interpreted as being not the most economically sound idea, they are not valid. Even though large sums of money is typically spent on each space exploration project, they are being injected back into the economy via engineer salaries, maying material costs to other companies, etc. In essence, the money is not "lost" because we sent a rocket to the depth of the abyss, it is simply redistributed amongst society. Additionally, as we've seen historically, where advancements in science aimed to advance military "accidentally" resulted in the birth of the internet, funding science in any field may result in significant benefits of other aspects of life. Therefore, space exploration should not be interpreted as an expense, rather an investment into potential innovations in the future.  

Lastly, some suggest that the notion of space flight is only as a means to "escape humanity", and that it is irresponsible to do so when we haven't actualised our sense of self yet. However, they are forgetting the fact that philosophy of finding one's self and the exploration into the unknown are two completely separate, independent aspects of humanity. Therefore, the two subjects should not be interpreted as replacements of one another, and it is completely possible to make advancements in both fields at the same time. Furthermore, it can even be argued that space exploration could be used as a means to further enhance one's self awareness and actualisation, as suggested by the famous quote by an astronomer the first time he saw the earth from space "...you develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, and the intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world..."  

In conclusion, space travel has not played a historically significant role & paved a path into who we are as humanity today, it also brings forth tremendous economical & philosophical benefits. Thus, space exploration should absolutely not be disregarded as a detriment to humanity as a whole.
